Portfolio
=========

This is my portfolio repository. It contains the following projects:

ecAEPS
------

A system for administering the AEPS, which is an assessment 
given to kids that are developmentally disabled. Replaced 
[AEPSi](http://www.aepsinteractive.com/index.htm) for the UO

googleauth
----------

A [drupal](http://drupal.org) plugin that exposes a SAML server specifically for 
use with Google Apps for Education -- this was a Google Summer of Code 
(2007) project

bugs
----

A bugtracking system I developed for my own use. It's written in TurboGears, and is, I claim,
easier to set up than Trac.

OpenID
------

I claim that this project is the first opensource OpenID server that actually works. I was thrashing around trying to find a working OpenID server at 2 in the morning the day 
of the first coding sprint that the University of Oregon's ACM student club was running, and could find nothing that worked out of the box, so I wrote this. It requires the 
python JanRain OpenID libraries, SQLObject, and Kid.
