This is my portfolio repository. It contains the following projects:

ecAEPS: A system for administering the AEPS, which is an assessment 
given to kids that are developmentally disabled. Replaced 
http://www.aepsinteractive.com/index.htm for the UO

googleauth: A drupal plugin that exposes a SAML server specifically for 
use with Google Apps for Education -- this was a Google Summer of Code 
(2007) project
